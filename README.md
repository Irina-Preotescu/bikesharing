## Overview of the Analysis

* The purpose of the analysis is well defined.
For this analysis, we used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column data type from an integer to datetime. Then, using the converted "tripduration" column, we created several visualization portraying the most important findings.

The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


## Results

* There is a description of the results for each visualization


## Summary
