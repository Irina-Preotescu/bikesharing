## Overview of the Analysis

For this analysis, we used Python and Pandas to change the "tripduration" column data type from an integer to datetime. Then, using the converted "tripduration" column, we created several visualization portraying the most important findings.

The analysis is focused on the following, with the purpose of proving to investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal:

1. The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.



## Results

* There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis 
* There is a description of the results for each visualization
